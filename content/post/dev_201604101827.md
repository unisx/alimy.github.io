It’s often practical to see what packages your app is importing. Unfortunately there isn’t a simple way to do that, however it is doable via the go list tool and using templates.

Go to your app and run the following.

```
$ go list -f '{{join .Deps "\n"}}' |  xargs go list -f '{{if not .Standard}}{{.ImportPath}}{{end}}'
```

Here is an example with the clirescue refactoring example:
```
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/GoBootcamp/clirescue
$ go list -f '{{join .Deps "\n"}}' | xargs go list -f '{{if not .Standard}}{{.ImportPath}}{{end}}'
github.com/GoBootcamp/clirescue/cmdutil
github.com/GoBootcamp/clirescue/trackerapi
github.com/GoBootcamp/clirescue/user
github.com/codegangsta/cli
```

If you want the list to also contain standard packages, edit the template and use:

```
$ go list -f '{{join .Deps "\n"}}' |  xargs go list -f '{{.ImportPath}}'
```
